# This is the classic fizz-buzz test.
# The test goes like this:
#   Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
#   But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
#   For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz."

a = 1;
while(a <= 100){
    if( a % 5 == 0 & a % 3 == 0){
        print("FizzBuzz");
    }elseif( a % 3 == 0 ){
        print("Fizz");
    }elseif( a % 5 == 0 ){
        print("Buzz");
    }else{
        print(a);
    };
    a = a + 1;
};
